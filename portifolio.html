                   I'm <span class="name">OJO BOLUWATIFE TEMITOPE</span>
                      a citizen of Nigeria where poverty is at it pik and the educational system is so poor that even a University certificate/diploma can't even guarantee your employement.
                    <br>A country so corrupt it's only connection that get you somewhere, CORRUPTION is so deep in the root of the people in the country that the only way to survive is to be one and part of the system.
                <br> So after giving to all this details of my background imagine how difficult it will be to survive, All this just point to the fact that my background is bad i still manage to pick the right part instead on following <bR>
                the wrong road becoming a fraudstar, hacker, yahoo boy, corrupt citizen and so on. Am proud that i survived because, hey like it or not life is all about survival.<br><br> 
            So my message to anyone reading this is to never give up, stay focus, No one is coming to save you, you are on your own, You have to work,learn,strive no matter your background, situation, state, condition and your nationality.<br>
